## About
This application contains APIs for inventory management. These APIs perform basic functions such as adding, updating, deleting products and listing products in inventory. The application was developed using Spring Boot and PgSQL database.

* In this project, I preferred to create basic functions (such as getter/setter, toString) manually instead of third-party libraries such as Lombok. Additionally, I developed a manual converter to convert between DTO (Data Transfer Object) and entity classes (Entity) for data transfer.
